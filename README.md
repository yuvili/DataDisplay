## GSR plot table

The participants in the experiment traveled in a slalom marked with cones in the "back" and "forth" directions. 
Each file in the simulator and remote driving includes one such round trip.
At the end of each beat we combined "man jumping on the road" - to create a "stress" surprise.
Each participant performed two beats in the simulator and two beats in real remote driving.
The difference between the two beats (both in the simulator and in remote driving) is:
1. The degree of delay - the time it takes for information from the vehicle to reach the operator is different (200 milliseconds or 300 milliseconds).
2. The distance we added the man jumping into the road (close or far).

For each of the two beats performed in the simulator - the route is printed using a scatter graph, where each point in the diagram is a different location. 
Each point on the line has a different color according to a physiological index called GSR (skin conductivity). 
The link between the physiological data and the data from the simulator file performed according to the 
Simulation time data.
